I was in my Turkish literature lesson when we learned about the following poem. Do note that we read the Turkish translation of the poem, which I added after the English version.

### The Art of Failing (Robert DiYanni)

The art of failing isn’t hard to master.  
Just draft your project with the aim to fail.  
Then fail better and fail faster. Skirt disaster.

Success is fine, but no match for failing well.  
Fail better, fail faster, and be smart.  
The art of failing isn’t hard to master.

So Samuel Beckett says about his art.  
Perfection eludes us at every turn.  
So fail better and smarter to forestall disaster.

You won’t get anything right from the start.  
Don’t try. Forgive yourself; make a mess.  
Avoid duress. Fail smarter to prevent disaster.

Failure, not success, is what you’re after.  
That’s where the surprises lurk—the discoveries.  
The art of failing isn’t hard to master.

Court failure. Don’t fear its painful pleasure.  
Follow missteps—embrace them, take their measure.  
The art of failing you can learn to master.  
Fail better, smarter, faster. Avert disaster.

### Çuvallama Sanatı (Robert DiYanni)

Öğrenmesi zor değildir çuvallama sanatını.  
Yalnızca çuvallamak için çıkar projenin taslağını.  
Sonra daha iyi, daha hızlı çuvalla. Teğet geç faciayı.  

Yarışamaz güzle bir başarısızlıkla, hoşsa da başarı.  
Daha iyi, daha hızlı çuvalla ve kazan aklı.  
Öğrenmesi zor değildir çuvallama sanatını.  

Budur Samuel Beckett'in kelamı, mevzubahis ise kendi sanatı.  
Kaçırırız her adımda o mükemmel fırsatı.  
Daha iyi, daha hızlı başarısız ol ki önle büyük kazayı.  

En baştan doğru atamazsın her adımı.  
Uğraşma. Sal kendini; terk et intizamı.  
Bırak icbarı, kazan aklı, engelle belayı.  

Çuvallamaktır maksudumuz, nedir ki başarı?  
Sinsi pusuların, sürpriz keşiflerin rotasıdır orası.  
Öğrenmesi zor değildir çuvallama sanatını.  

Ara, bul başarısızlığı. Korkma acı veren hazzından.  
Sarıl, al ölçüsünü yanlış adımın, hatta git arkasından.  
Öğrenebilirsin çuvallama sanatını, olmak için ustası.  
Daha iyi, akıllı, hızlı çuvalla ki teğet geç faciayı.

We were tasked with writing an analysis essay on the poem by DiYanni, to which I added my entire Turkish essay at the end of this blog. When I first read the poem, I was very intrigued by it. Because it basically threw all of our knowledge about drafting and succeeding out of the window into the trash bin. We are taught that we need to succeed in our lives, in exams, and in the projects and essays we do. As DiYanni points out, we actually shouldn't aim to succeed; we should aim to not succeed and we should aim to **fail**, which is very counterintuitive to our understanding of succeeding. But when we think about it, we actually should aim to fail. We shouldn't scrutinise everything that we do, but we should let it do whatever life wants, and we should aim to fail.

In a very theoretical scenario (my life right now), imagine that I need to write a college essay for university applications. My aim right now will be to write that essay really well. So, I will be drafting, drafting, drafting, and drafting to write the perfect essay, and I will, on most occasions, be writing better essays after every draft. This suggests that my main idea and aim for the first draft is going to be to write a bad essay. This is exactly what we think when we are drafting a project or an essay. We don't think about writing the perfect essay in one try; we know that the first draft is going to be garbage, and that's why we draft: to have an essay that is better than the previous one.

I firmly believe that this poem is great at describing how important it is to fail. Not only in essays, exams, and projects, but even in life. That's how we are going to learn. Also, we shouldn't be demoralised or quit, even if we fail after failing in the same context. We actually should want to fail faster and better, as DiYanni says in his poem.

That is all from me for now. As I gave hints to, I am in the season of writing college essays and personal statements to get into a good university, so don't expect me to write often on this blog (don't mind me writing another blog post literally 4 months later). See you then; goodbye.
